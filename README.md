# Enterprise RAG Platform — MVP Assets

This folder contains launch artifacts for a 24-hour MVP launch:
- `LANDING.md` — one-page product positioning
- `QUICKSTART.md` — minimal API examples and curl commands
- `API_SPEC.md` — concise API surface for engineers
- `PILOT_EMAIL.md` — outreach template for target customers
- `PRICING_ONE_PAGER.md` — pilot pricing and conversion plan

Next steps (suggested):
- Scaffold the FastAPI backend and routes from `API_SPEC.md`.
- Prepare demo dataset (Markdown) and ingest using `QUICKSTART.md` flow.
- Deploy to a lightweight VM or cloud function and publish `LANDING.md` as the public page.
