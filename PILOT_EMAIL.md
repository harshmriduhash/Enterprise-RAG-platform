Subject: Pilot invite — Enterprise RAG Platform (RAG as API)

Hi {Name},

I'm launching a compact RAG-as-API MVP that exposes private knowledge as a secure, multi-tenant API. Given your team's work on internal search/AI, I'd love to invite you to a short paid pilot (14–30 days) to validate the integration and value.

What's included:
- Fast setup (1–2 days) and one-time onboarding
- Secure tenant with RBAC and API keys
- Ingestion of one knowledge source and hybrid retrieval
- Observability: token usage, query logs, basic eval metrics
- Manual invoicing and pilot support

Pilot pricing (intro):
- Setup: ₹75k (one-time, discounted)
- Usage: manual invoicing based on tokens & embeddings

If interested, I'll schedule a 30-minute kickoff and ingest a demo dataset to show results. Are you available for a short call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
